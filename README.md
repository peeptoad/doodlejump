Have you ever wanted to be a tiny, doodle-like character jumping on precarious platforms, desperately trying to reach the moon? No? Well, too bad, because that's exactly what you'll be doing in Doodle Jump.
Just try not to fall into the infinite abyss of doom (also known as the bottom of the screen).
